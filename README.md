# Bayesian-Toxicity-Modeling
- This Shiny app utilizes a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate the probability of toxicity at different dose levels.
- It provides a data-driven approach to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by incorporating prior knowledge and observed toxicity data, helping to balance efficacy and safety in dose selection.
